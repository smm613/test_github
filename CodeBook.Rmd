**DATA FILES**

The script that created the two data sets, called run\_analysis.R, is included in the repository. The script assumes that the zipped file containing the assignment information has been downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The files were unzipped to the R working directory. The following files were used in the script:

1. activity\_labels.txt (found in the UCI HAR Datasetfolder)
2. features.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset folder)
3. subject\_test.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/test folder)
4. X\_test.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/test folder)
5. y\_test.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/test folder)
6. subject\_train.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/train folder)
7. X\_train.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/train folder)
8. y\_train.txt (found in the UCI HAR Dataset/train folder)

The six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying) were listed with the corresponding codes (one through six) in activity\_labels.txt. The subject identifiers (one through 30?) were in subject\_xxx.txt for the respective test or train group. Each subject identifier was in a separate row. The X\_test.txt and X\_train.txt files contain the measurement data.

**PROCESSING THE DATA**

The test and train files were processed separately, then merged. The reason was to ensure that there was sufficient memory to do the processing. Since the number of rows in the subject_test.txt, x_test.txt and y_test.txt files was the same (2,947), the assumption was made that the order of the rows should be preserved to link the subject, the activity and the data. This assumption held when examining the number of rows (7352) for the corresponding files in the "train" group.

A sequential index variable (1 through the number of rows) was created for each file to facilitate the merging of these three files. The merge() command was used to merge the files based on the index value.

**EXTRACTING THE REQUESTED VARIABLES**

The variable names for the data were taken from features.txt. Since the instructions were to extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements, the grep() function was used to search for "mean", "std", and "Mean". The selected variables were placed in a temporary file along with the corresponding row number (i.e., selected numbers between 1 and 561.) The variable names are listed below in a section called "Variables". The row numbers were retained to select out the relevant columns from the data frame. They were also retained to enable easy renaming of the variable names, or columns, using match().

**COMBINING THE TEST AND TRAIN DATA**

The test and train data were then concatenated using rbind(), with the test data followed by the train data for a total of 10,299 rows. 

**VARIABLE NAMES**

The mean and standard deviation variables or columns that were selected were renamed using match(). The original column name took the form "Vx" where x is the variable number. A "V" was appended to the row numbers that were saved to the temporary file mentioned above. This allowed the match() function to substitute the "Vx" with the variable name.

Value labels were specified for each of the six activities using the factor() function. The labels include: (1) "walking", (2) "walking upstairs", (3) "walking downstairs", (4) "sitting", (5) "standing", and (6) "laying".

The file, called combined.csv, is located in the repository.

**CREATION OF SECOND FILE**

In order to create the second file, which contains the average of each variable in the combined data set calculated for each activity/subject combination, ddply() from the dply library was used. The output from the function call includes yy rows with the subject id, activity, and the averages for the 61 variables. 

The file, called averages.csv, is located in the repository.

**VARIABLES**

The following variables were extracted based on the occurrence of the words "mean", "std", and "Mean" in the variable name. Also included is the variable number from the original list.
